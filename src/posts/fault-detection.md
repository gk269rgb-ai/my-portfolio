In this project, I explored deep learning models for classifying transmission line faults.  
Using CNNs and 2D feature extraction from current and voltage signals, I built a multi-class classification model.  
Real-time validation was performed using MATLAB Simulink integration.  

**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, MATLAB-Simulink, Deep Learning.
