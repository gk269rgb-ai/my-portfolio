        <p style={styles.text}>
          I am <b>Gunjan Kumar</b>, a recent graduate with a 
          <b> B.Tech in Electrical Engineering</b> from 
          <b> IITRAM (Batch of 2025)</b>. I was recognized as the 
          <b> Gold Medalist in Electrical Engineering</b> and honored with the 
          <b> Deanâ€™s Certificate for Academic Excellence</b>. I have consistently 
          demonstrating strong academic performance throughout my studies.
        </p>

        <p style={styles.text}>
          My passion lies in <b>Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, 
          and Deep Learning research</b>. I have applied advanced AI models 
          to real-world domains including <b>power systems, biomedical signals, 
          robotics, automation, and natural language processing</b>.
        </p>

        <p style={styles.text}>
          Some of my key works include <b>Real-time fault detection in 220kV 
          transmission lines using CNNs, Insomnia detection from ECG signals, 
          human-following robots, and AI-powered content generation for 
          Mathematics and Physics domains</b>. These projects have strengthened 
          my expertise in <b>data preprocessing, model design, simulation, 
          and performance optimization</b>.
        </p>

        <p style={styles.text}>
          My long-term career aspiration is to become a 
          <b>Research Scientist or AI/ML Engineer</b> at leading global 
          organizations such as <b>Google, Microsoft, or other top MNCs</b>, 
          where I can contribute to cutting-edge innovations at the 
          intersection of <b>AI, science, and engineering</b>.
